# Angular-Spring-application
Faculty project where I used Angular 17 on frontend and Spring framework on backend. Also I used MicrosoftSQL database and JPA/Hibernate ORM. Project is simulation of Rent application for cars, bicycles and electric scooters. Of course, because of deadlines, possible there is a few violations of DRY and Clean code principles.

Spring Boot (Backend, Server) app is inside demo folder. Beside Spring, I used JPA for connection and relation to DB.
